## About

FrostBites is a full-stack web application developed as part of my project at SENA
Institution. Designed with both user convenience and functionality in mind, the
application showcases a practical implementation of modern web development principles.
This project really helped me sharpen my skills in building applications that are secure,
user friendly, and built to last
